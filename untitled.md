> In a subscription-based business, even a small rate of monthly/quarterly churn will compound quickly over time. Just 1 percent monthly churn translates to almost 12 percent yearly churn. Given that it’s far more expensive to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, businesses with high churn rates will quickly find themselves in a financial hole as they have to devote more and more resources to new customer acquisition.

As with any machine learning task, data science specialists first need data to work with. Depending on the goal, researchers define what data they must collect. Next, selected data is prepared, preprocessed, and transformed in a form suitable for building machine learning models. Finding the right methods to training machines, fine-tuning the models, and selecting the best performers is another significant part of the work. Once a model that makes predictions with the highest accuracy is chosen, it can be put into production.

    The overall scope of work data scientists carry out to build ML-powered systems capable to forecast customer attrition may look like the following:

    Understanding a problem and final goal

    Data collection

    Data preparation and preprocessing

    Modeling and testing

    Model deployment and monitoring

    Understanding a problem and a final goalIt’s important to understand what insights one needs to get from the analysis. In short, you must decide what question to ask and consequently what type of machine learning problem to solve: classification or regression.

    customer demographic features that contain basic information about a customer (e.g., age, education level, location, income)

    user behavior features describing how a person uses a service or product (e.g., lifecycle stage, number of times they log in into their accounts, active session length, time of the day when a product is used actively, features or modules used, actions, monetary value)

    support features that characterize interactions with customer support (e.g., queries sent, number of interactions, history of customer satisfaction scores)

    contextual features representing other contextual information about a customer.
